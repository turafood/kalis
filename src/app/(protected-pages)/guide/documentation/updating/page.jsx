                Since the platform doesn&apos;t include a built-in version
                control system, updating your templates can be challenging.
                However, here are some tips to help you keep your templates up
                to date more easily.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Before starting a new project, consider hosting the original
                    template in your own repository.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Create a branch from the repository to use as your
                    workspace.
                </li>
                <li>
                    When a new update is released, push the latest
                    version&apos;s content to your repository.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Merge your workspace branch with the original branch to
                    incorporate the latest changes.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </>
    )
